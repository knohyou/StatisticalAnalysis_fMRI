Project: Effects of Quasi-periodic Pattern Regression on BOLD Signals Correlated with Infraslow and Higher Frequency Electrophysiology.

Goal: Understand neural activity of the brain using fMRI and electropysiology dataset.

Studied BOLD fMRI signals in terms of neural activity by correlating BOLD with electrophysiology mice dataset. Implemented a pattern finding algorithm and linear regression to extract and remove quasi-periodic patterns (QPPs) from the BOLD signal. Demonstrated that infraslow and higher frequency neural activities contribute to the QPP BOLD patterns but vary in degree.
